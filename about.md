My name is Jonathan Hui. I started this blog to share my excitement about Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Many articles here served as my personal notes. I wish that some of them give you better insights beyond the equations and give you enough details to explore.

I also maintain a second blog in https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/ which have more latest article. Here is an index to this article: https://medium.com/@jonathan-hui/index-page-for-my-articles-in-deep-learning-19821810a14.

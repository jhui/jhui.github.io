Hello, I'm Jonathan Hui. I created this blog to share my enthusiasm for Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning with others. Most of the articles here are my personal notes, which I hope will provide you with valuable insights beyond just the equations. My aim is to offer enough details to encourage exploration and a deeper understanding of these topics.

I also maintain a second blog in https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/ which have more latest articles. Here is an index to those articles: https://medium.com/@jonathan-hui/index-page-for-my-articles-in-deep-learning-19821810a14.
